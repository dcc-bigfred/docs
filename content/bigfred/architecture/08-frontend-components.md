## 6. Frontend Components

### 6.1 WebSocket Hook (`useSocket.ts`)

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from "react";
import { useLocoStore } from "./store";

type Envelope = { type: string; id?: string; payload?: unknown };

export function useSocket(url: string) {
  const wsRef = useRef<WebSocket | null>(null);
  const applyEvent = useLocoStore((s) => s.applyEvent);

  const connect = useCallback(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(url);
    wsRef.current = ws;

    ws.onmessage = (e) => {
      const env: Envelope = JSON.parse(e.data);
      applyEvent(env);
    };
    ws.onclose = () => setTimeout(connect, 1000); // reconnect with backoff
  }, [url, applyEvent]);

  useEffect(() => {
    connect();
    return () => wsRef.current?.close();
  }, [connect]);

  const send = useCallback((env: Envelope) => {
    wsRef.current?.send(JSON.stringify(env));
  }, []);

  return { send };
}
```

### 6.2 Zustand Store for Locomotive State

```ts
import { create } from "zustand";

type LocoState = {
  addr: number;
  speed: number;
  forward: boolean;
  functions: number[];
};

type Store = {
  locos: Record<number, LocoState>;
  applyEvent: (env: { type: string; payload?: any }) => void;
};

export const useLocoStore = create<Store>((set) => ({
  locos: {},
  applyEvent: (env) => {
    if (env.type === "loco.state") {
      const st = env.payload as LocoState;
      set((s) => ({ locos: { ...s.locos, [st.addr]: st } }));
    }
  },
}));
```

### 6.3 Control Component (Material UI)

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardActions,
  Typography,
  Slider,
  Stack,
  IconButton,
  ToggleButton,
  ToggleButtonGroup,
} from "@mui/material";
import PlayArrowIcon from "@mui/icons-material/PlayArrow";
import ArrowBackIcon from "@mui/icons-material/ArrowBack";
import ArrowForwardIcon from "@mui/icons-material/ArrowForward";
import StopIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Stop";

function LocoControl({ addr }: { addr: number }) {
  const { send } = useSocket(`ws://${location.host}/api/v1/ws`);
  const state = useLocoStore((s) => s.locos[addr]);

  useEffect(() => {
    send({ type: "loco.subscribe", payload: { addr } });
    return () => send({ type: "loco.unsubscribe", payload: { addr } });
  }, [addr, send]);

  const setSpeed = (speed: number) =>
    send({
      type: "loco.setSpeed",
      payload: { addr, speed, forward: state?.forward ?? true },
    });

  const setDirection = (forward: boolean) =>
    send({
      type: "loco.setSpeed",
      payload: { addr, speed: state?.speed ?? 0, forward },
    });

  return (
    <Card sx={{ maxWidth: 480, m: 2 }}>
      <CardContent>
        <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom>
          Loco #{addr}
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary" gutterBottom>
          {state?.speed ?? 0} step{state?.forward ? " ▶" : " ◀"}
        </Typography>
        <Slider
          value={state?.speed ?? 0}
          min={0}
          max={127}
          aria-label="Throttle"
          onChange={(_, v) => setSpeed(v as number)}
        />
      </CardContent>
      <CardActions>
        <ToggleButtonGroup
          exclusive
          value={state?.forward ? "fwd" : "rev"}
          onChange={(_, v) => v && setDirection(v === "fwd")}
          size="small"
        >
          <ToggleButton value="rev" aria-label="Reverse">
            <ArrowBackIcon />
          </ToggleButton>
          <ToggleButton value="fwd" aria-label="Forward">
            <ArrowForwardIcon />
          </ToggleButton>
        </ToggleButtonGroup>
        <IconButton color="error" onClick={() => setSpeed(0)} aria-label="Stop">
          <StopIcon />
        </IconButton>
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### 6.3a Train control in the Throttle overlay

Train driving is **not** a separate page. It lives inside the same
full-screen Throttle overlay as single-vehicle control (`ThrottlePage` →
`ThrottleCockpit`, §6.3b). The picker lists **vehicles and trains**
together (`useThrottleTargetSelection` persists the last target in
`localStorage`).

When a **train** is selected:

- the slider / direction / stop dispatch **`train.setSpeed` on the
  data-plane WS** (`useDccBus().setTrainSpeed`, debounced via
  `useDebouncedTrainSpeedSend`) — not on `loco-server`'s control plane;
- speed and direction are read from the **leading member's**
  `loco.state` (first powered, non-excluded member in `Position` order);
- the client **`loco.subscribe`s every powered member address** on the
  data plane (no `train.subscribe`);
- the function area becomes `<TrainFunctionAccordions>` — one collapsed
  accordion per powered member, leading first; each summary shows the
  member name, a small **current DCC speed** read from that member's
  `loco.state`, and (for the leading vehicle) a *prowadzący* chip;
  each body is that member's `<FunctionGridButton>` grid wired to
  `loco.toggleFn` on the data plane;
- the train owner sees a **cog** on **every** powered member (including
  the leading one) that opens `<TrainMemberSettingsDialog>` and persists
  per-member timing via `PATCH /api/v1/trains/{id}/members/{memberId}`
  (lessees: cog hidden).

#### Per-member settings (`TrainMemberSettingsDialog`)

Owner-only cog popup. Fields depend on whether the member is the
**leading vehicle**:

| Field | Trailing members | Leading vehicle |
|---|---|---|
| `speedMultiplier` (0.05–4.0) | editable | **fixed 1.0** (not sent on PATCH) |
| `excludeFromSpeed` | checkbox | **not offered** |
| `startDelayMs` | 0 or 50–1000 ms (step 50) | editable |
| `accelRampMs` + `accelRampMaxSteps` | 0 or 0.5–5 s (step 0.5 s), 1–10 steps | editable |
| `brakeRampMs` + `brakeRampMaxSteps` | same ranges as accel ramp | editable |

When `excludeFromSpeed` is checked on a trailing member, all timing
fields are cleared on save and that vehicle is skipped by
`train.setSpeed` fan-out on the daemon.

Strings live under `throttle.json` → `train.memberSettings.*` (pl + en).

#### How `dcc-bus` applies member timing

Each `train.setSpeed` is handled by `TrainSpeedScheduler`
(`pkgs/bigfred/dcc-bus/service/train_speed_scheduler.go`). A new command
**cancels** any pending delay/ramp goroutines for that train.

Per powered member (after computing the effective target speed from the
slider, multiplier, and `Reversed`):

1. **Acceleration ramp** — when target **>** current, `accelRampMs > 0`,
   and either the member is already above the consist-start threshold
   (DCC speed > 1) **or** `startDelayMs == 0`. The daemon issues
   intermediate `setSpeed` steps in one goroutine: **apply first, then
   `sleep`** between steps. Total ramp duration and max steps come from
   member settings; step count is reduced until each interval is ≥
   500 ms.
2. **Braking ramp** — when target **<** current and `brakeRampMs > 0`.
   Same step/sleep pattern as acceleration (including stop to 0).
3. **Start delay** — on a consist **start** (leading vehicle was at DCC
   speed ≤ 1), when the member is also at speed ≤ 1, `startDelayMs > 0`,
   and acceleration ramp does **not** apply: a single `sleep`, then one
   immediate `setSpeed` to the target.
4. **Immediate** — otherwise the target speed is written synchronously.

Acceleration ramp **takes precedence** over start delay when both could
apply at standstill (start delay only wins when acceleration ramp is
disabled or blocked because `startDelayMs > 0` and current speed ≤ 1).

The slider witness stays the **leading** member; trailing speeds may lag
during ramps and appear in each accordion header.

```tsx
// ThrottlePage.tsx (ConnectedThrottle, excerpt — train branch)
const { setTrainSpeed, setFunction, subscribe, states } = useDccBus();
const trainCtx = useSelectedTrainContext(layoutID, trainId);

useEffect(() => {
  void subscribe(trainCtx.poweredMembers.map((m) => m.dccAddress));
}, [trainCtx.poweredMembers, subscribe]);

const witness = states.get(trainCtx.leadingAddr);
const { queueSpeed } = useDebouncedTrainSpeedSend(setTrainSpeed);

// slider → queueSpeed(trainId, speed, forward)
// accordions → states.get(member.dccAddress)?.speed in header;
//              setFunction(member.dccAddress, fn, on) in body
```

Single-vehicle selection keeps the flat function grid and
`loco.setSpeed` unchanged. `<TakeoverThrottleOverlay>` still drives one
vehicle via the legacy `selectedAddress` props on `ThrottleCockpit`.

### 6.3b Throttle mode – full-screen overlay

**Throttle mode** (*tryb sterowania „Throttle”*, see §1) is how a
**driver** or a **signalman** (after a granted **takeover**) operates a
**vehicle** or **train** in real time. It is not a separate application
route the user navigates away from: it is a layer above the rest of
BigFred that hosts the driving surface (`ThrottleSlider`, function and
script buttons, command-station picker, script console, takeover
banners, dead-man's switch affordances).

#### Entry, exit and shell layout

The sticky top **AppBar** in `AppShell.tsx` carries a **Throttle** button
(labelled via `vehicle.json`, icon: engineer / *maszynista*) among the
account-level controls. Clicking it toggles throttle mode:

- **Open** – a full-screen overlay is rendered immediately below the
  `AppBar`. It occupies the remaining viewport height (`position:
  fixed`, top aligned to the AppBar, high `z-index`). Every other page
  (admin screens, vehicle lists, future radio panel) stays mounted
  underneath but is visually covered; only the **AppBar remains visible**.
- **Close** – the same button (or an explicit close control on the
  overlay) dismisses the layer without tearing down WebSocket
  subscriptions, so re-entry is instant.

Gating: the button is shown to users who may drive at least one vehicle
or train in the current session layout (drivers on owned/leased scope;
signalmen only while they hold active takeover authority on a target).
Exact rules follow the permission matrix in §11.

#### Controls available inside the overlay

While throttle mode is open and driving authority is held, the operator
can:

- set speed and direction (`loco.setSpeed` / `train.setSpeed`),
- toggle registered DCC functions (`loco.toggleFn`),
- start and stop attached scripts (`script.run` / `script.stop`),
- trigger emergency braking (`system.estop`);
- trigger **Radio Stop** (`system.radioStop`, §4.6) – layout-wide
  halt with confirmation overlay and radiostop sound on every throttle
  session.

Throttle commands (`loco.*`, `train.setSpeed`, `system.estop`) travel
over the **data-plane** WebSocket to `dcc-bus` (§7e.4). Radio Stop and
other control-plane actions use `/api/v1/ws` (§4.2, §7e.7).

#### Left toolbar – Fullscreen and Radio Stop

The overlay renders a thin **toolbar pinned to its left edge**
(`<ThrottleToolbar>`), above the vehicle/train driving surface. Two
controls live there, left to right:

1. **Fullscreen toggle** (`<FullscreenButton>`) – toggles the browser
   Fullscreen API on the overlay container
   (`element.requestFullscreen()` / `document.exitFullscreen()`). The
   icon flips between `Fullscreen` and `FullscreenExit` based on
   `document.fullscreenElement`. Strings: `throttle.fullscreen.enter` /
   `throttle.fullscreen.exit`. Shown to every operator in throttle
   mode (no extra gate).
2. **Radio Stop** (`<RadioStopButton>`) – sits immediately to the right
   of the Fullscreen toggle. Red, radio-handset icon. Rendered **only**
   when `useCanDriveAny()` passes (same gate as the AppBar Throttle
   toggle and §4.6.2). Pressing it opens `<RadioStopConfirmOverlay>`.

`<RadioStopConfirmOverlay>` is a centred MUI `Dialog` containing a
primary **red** button **„Uruchom radiostop”** and, below it, a neutral
**„Anuluj”**. Only the former dispatches `system.radioStop {}` on the
**control plane** (`useControlPlane()`), then closes; „Anuluj” just
dismisses. Strings: `throttle.radioStop.button`,
`throttle.radioStop.run`, `throttle.radioStop.cancel`,
`throttle.radioStop.tooltip`.

```tsx
// ThrottleToolbar.tsx (excerpt)
function ThrottleToolbar({ overlayRef }: { overlayRef: RefObject<HTMLElement> }) {
  const canDrive = useCanDriveAny();
  return (
    <Stack className="throttle-toolbar" direction="row" spacing={1}>
      <FullscreenButton target={overlayRef} />
      {canDrive && <RadioStopButton />}
    </Stack>
  );
}

function RadioStopButton() {
  const { send } = useControlPlane();
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <>
      <IconButton color="error" aria-label={t("throttle:radioStop.button")}
                  onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>
        <SettingsInputAntennaIcon />
      </IconButton>
      <Dialog open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
        <Stack spacing={2} sx={{ p: 3, alignItems: "stretch" }}>
          <Button variant="contained" color="error" size="large"
                  onClick={() => { send({ type: "system.radioStop", payload: {} }); setOpen(false); }}>
            {t("throttle:radioStop.run")}
          </Button>
          <Button variant="text" onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>
            {t("throttle:radioStop.cancel")}
          </Button>
        </Stack>
      </Dialog>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Radiostop alarm playback

A small `useRadioStopSound()` hook (mounted once inside the overlay)
subscribes to the control-plane `system.radioStop` push event and
plays the bundled asset at **`/sounds/radiostop.ogg`**:

```tsx
function useRadioStopSound() {
  useControlPlaneEvent("system.radioStop", () => {
    new Audio("/sounds/radiostop.ogg").play().catch(() => {/* autoplay blocked */});
  });
}
```

The same clip plays on **every** open throttle session in the layout
(the operator who pressed the button and everyone else), so the alarm
is heard simultaneously. Non-throttle surfaces (dashboard) receive the
same event but only show a toast (`throttle.radioStop.toast`) — they do
not mount the audio hook.

#### Radio and chat (driver side)

The throttle toolbar carries **two more icons next to the Radio Stop
button**: a **radio** icon and a **chat** icon. They are the driver's
walkie-talkie surface (§4.4) and are independent of the layout-wide
Radio Stop.

**Radio icon (`<ThrottleRadioButton>` → `<ThrottleRadioOverlay>`).**
Opens an on-screen overlay used to **send** a radio message about the
**currently driven** vehicle/train (that target is the message
`context`). The overlay stacks, top to bottom:

1. **Interlocking picker** — a **text field with search** that filters
   the layout's interlockings (`GET /api/v1/interlockings`); the picked
   box becomes `to.interlockingId`.
2. **Phrase picker** — the same **searchable table** of the closed
   `RadioPhrase` vocabulary used on the signalman side
   (`<RadioPhrasePickerDialog>`), so the driver visually finds the phrase.

Selecting a phrase emits
`radio.send { to:{ interlockingId }, context:{ vehicleId | trainId }, phrase }`
and plays `/sounds/interlockings/radio-sent.ogg` on ack.

**Chat icon (`<ThrottleChatButton>` → `<ThrottleChatOverlay>`).** Opens a
popup/overlay showing **this driver's chat history with the various
signalmen** (their own conversations only, §4.4.3), seeded via
`radio.replay { scope:"user" }` (Redis, §4.4.4) and kept live by
`radio.message`. Same line format as the signalman panel.

**Unread indicator + incoming alert.** When a `radio.message` arrives for
the driver:

- the **chat icon lights red** (an unread badge) until the chat overlay
  is opened;
- an **alert-style popup** is shown in the throttle view (similar to an
  on-screen alert), surfacing the translated phrase and its
  vehicle/train context;
- the receiver plays `/sounds/interlockings/{phrase}.ogg`.

A small `useRadioSounds()` hook (sibling of `useRadioStopSound()`,
§6.3b) plays `radio-sent.ogg` on the sender's `radio.send` ack and
`{phrase}.ogg` on each inbound `radio.message`.

#### Server as source of truth (multi-pilot sync)

The DCC bus and the backend **command station** are shared state. A
physical throttle on the layout, another browser tab, or an external
API/MCP client may change the same locomotive while BigFred is open.
The overlay therefore **must not treat the last outbound command as
ground truth**. Instead it renders from server push events — principally
`loco.state` for speed, direction and the runtime `functions` array —
and re-fetches function definitions on `vehicle.functionsChanged`. When
an external pilot moves the speed step or flips a function, every open
throttle overlay subscribed to that address converges to the server
state within one polling/event round trip (see M1 acceptance criteria).

When a **takeover** is active, the affected **driver's** overlay for
that target becomes read-only telemetry (`controlledBy.kind ==
"signalman"`); the **signalman's** overlay receives full write access
until `takeover.released`.

#### Illustrative shell wiring

```tsx
// AppShell.tsx (excerpt) – Throttle toggle on the top bar
import EngineeringIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Engineering";
import { ThrottleOverlay } from "./ThrottleOverlay";

export function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [throttleOpen, setThrottleOpen] = useState(false);
  const canDrive = useCanDriveAny(); // owned, leased, or takeover-held scope

  return (
    <>
      <AppBar position="sticky">
        <Toolbar>
          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>BigFred</Typography>
          {canDrive && (
            <IconButton
              color="inherit"
              aria-label={t("vehicle:throttle.open")}
              aria-pressed={throttleOpen}
              onClick={() => setThrottleOpen((v) => !v)}
            >
              <EngineeringIcon />
            </IconButton>
          )}
          {/* account / admin menus, locale toggle … */}
        </Toolbar>
      </AppBar>

      <main>{children}</main>

      {throttleOpen && (
        <ThrottleOverlay onClose={() => setThrottleOpen(false)} />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

`ThrottleOverlay` hosts vehicle/train selection and mounts
`ThrottlePage` / `ThrottleCockpit` content from §6.3a and §6.3b.

#### Dual-WebSocket model (after §7e ships)

When §7e is live, the overlay manages **two** independent WebSocket
connections (see §7e.7 for the full lifecycle):

1. **Control-plane WS** to `loco-server` (`/api/v1/ws`) — already
   open since login. Carries `session.*`, `takeover.*`, `radio.*`,
   `script.*`, `presence`, `auth.elevationChanged`, and the
   command-station picker (`session.setCommandStation` /
   `session.commandStationChanged`).
2. **Data-plane WS** to the picked `dcc-bus` daemon
   (`ws://host:<port>/ws?token=<jwt>`, returned via
   `session.opened.availableCommandStations[i].wsUrl`). Carries
   `loco.subscribe` / `loco.unsubscribe` / `loco.setSpeed` /
   `loco.toggleFn` / `train.setSpeed` / `system.estop` / `ping`.
   Re-opened when the user switches command stations.

`<ThrottleCockpit>` slider and function toggles dispatch on the data
plane via `useDccBus()`; `<ScriptButtons>`, the takeover banner and
the radio panel keep using the control plane (`useSocket`). Selecting
the right socket is encapsulated; component code does **not** know
about ports.

The command-station dropdown inside `<ThrottleHeader>` renders
`status` per row (`RUNNING` / `STOPPED` / `STARTING` / `DEGRADED`)
based on `availableCommandStations[i].status` and disables rows
whose `wsUrl == null` until the user selects them (selection
triggers daemon spawn). The `<SharedBusChip>` lights up when
`dcc-bus.opened.sharedBus === true` to surface §3a.4 rule 9 to the
driver.

#### Settings icon — connection and command-retry feedback

The **settings / cog** control in `<ThrottleCockpit>` (top-right of the
driving header) opens `<ThrottleSetupDialog>`: command-station picker,
control-plane and data-plane connection chips, and spawn error retry
(§17). Its icon reflects transient reliability state instead of showing
reconnect toasts in the overlay.

| Visual | Condition | `aria-label` key |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| `SettingsIcon` (default) | Data plane connected; no command retry in flight | `throttle:setup.open` |
| `CircularProgress` (small) | Data-plane reconnect after a prior successful open (`connectionLost`: `dccReconnecting`, or `status` `closed` / `error`) | `throttle:reconnecting` |
| Rotating `SyncIcon` | A driving command or **Radio Stop** is being resent (`commandRetrying` from speed / train-speed / function hooks, or `radioStopRetrying` from `<RadioStopButton onRetryingChange>`) | `throttle:commandRetrying` |

**Priority:** connection lost beats command retry; the cog is **disabled**
while either spinner is shown so setup cannot be opened mid-handshake.

`ThrottlePage` passes `connectionLost` and `commandRetrying` into
`<ThrottleCockpit>`; radio-stop retry state is collected inside the
cockpit from the left-toolbar `<RadioStopButton>`. Full retry budgets
and WebSocket backoff are documented in
[§17 Reliability](./17-reliability.md).

### 6.3e Vehicle catalogue and function editor

Route for the owner's **vehicle catalogue** (*lista pojazdów / lokomotyw*):
`/vehicles` (`LocoListPage.tsx`). The page lists every vehicle the caller
owns (`GET /api/v1/vehicles`, filtered to `ownerUserId == me`), with columns
for kind, DCC address, name and number. Each row exposes two owner-only
actions in the trailing action column:

| Control | Icon (MUI) | Behaviour |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Edytuj** | `Edit` | Opens `VehicleDialog` — metadata form (name, kind, number, optional DCC address, **Rp1 function** default F2, **emergency lights function** default F0, **Dead Man's Switch** option) persisted on `domain.Vehicle` and copied into the `allowed_vehicles` Redis snapshot for `dcc-bus` (§7e.5). |
| **Edytuj funkcje** | `Tune` (or `Functions`) | Navigates to `/vehicles/{addr}/functions` — the function-definition editor described below. Tooltip and `aria-label` come from `vehicle.json` (`vehicle.functions.edit`). |

Lessees and non-owners never see either action. Vehicles without a DCC
address (*dummy*) may still open the function editor (definitions are stored
for when an address is added later), but the throttle will not emit DCC for
them until `dccAddress` is set.

#### Function editor page (`VehicleFunctionsPage.tsx`)

Route: `/vehicles/{addr}/functions`. Header shows vehicle name and DCC
address; a back link returns to `/vehicles`.

The page edits the **resolved** function list for that vehicle
(`GET /api/v1/vehicles/{addr}/functions`). When `source: "template"` the UI
shows a read-only banner (“Lista dziedziczona ze szablonu …”) until the
first mutation, which triggers server-side copy-on-write (§3a.6).

**Adding a slot** — toolbar button **Dodaj funkcję** opens a dialog:

- **Numer** — pick an unused DCC slot from `F0`–`F31` (dropdown of free
  numbers only).
- **Tytuł** — free-text label shown on the throttle button and in tooltips
  (`name` field on the wire).
- **Ikona** — visual picker grid populated from
  `GET /api/v1/function-icons` (closed catalogue in
  [§3a.8](./05-domain-model/08-function-icon-catalogue.md)); choosing an
  icon while **Tytuł** is empty copies the icon label into the title field.

Confirming calls `PUT …/functions/{num}`.

**Editing** — each list row is editable for title and icon;
changes debounce to the same `PUT` endpoint.

**Removing** — row action **Usuń** → `DELETE …/functions/{num}`.

**Reordering** — the list is a drag-and-drop sortable (`@dnd-kit` or
equivalent). On drop the client posts
`POST …/functions/reorder { positions: [{ num, position }, …] }`.
`position` is dense `0..n-1` in display order.

The list is sorted by `position` ascending at all times. **The same order
is used in throttle mode**: `<FunctionButtons>` renders one button per
registered function, left-to-right / top-to-bottom in `position` order.
Reordering on this page therefore immediately changes how the driver sees
functions in the **Throttle** overlay (after refetch or
`vehicle.functionsChanged`).

**Throttle visibility** — every function row the owner registered for this
vehicle appears in `<FunctionButtons>` for that vehicle inside throttle mode
(§6.3b). There is no separate “favourites” subset: the catalogue on this page
*is* the throttle button row (scripts from §6.7 still append after the
function buttons). Lessees and signalmen with driving authority see the same
buttons but cannot open this editor.

```tsx
// VehicleFunctionsPage.tsx (structure sketch)
function VehicleFunctionsPage() {
  const { addr } = useParams();
  const { data: fns = [], refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["vehicle-functions", addr],
    queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/v1/vehicles/${addr}/functions`).then((r) => r.json()),
  });
  const icons = useFunctionIcons(); // GET /api/v1/function-icons, cached

  const onReorder = (ordered: ResolvedFunction[]) =>
    fetch(`/api/v1/vehicles/${addr}/functions/reorder`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        positions: ordered.map((f, i) => ({ num: f.num, position: i })),
      }),
    }).then(() => refetch());

  return (
    <Container>
      <FunctionList
        items={fns.sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position)}
        icons={icons}
        onReorder={onReorder}
        onSave={(f) => putFunction(addr, f)}
        onDelete={(num) => deleteFunction(addr, num)}
      />
    </Container>
  );
}
```

`FunctionButtons.tsx` already sorts by `position` when rendering; no
second sort key is applied in the throttle.

### 6.3c Layout dashboard (`HomePage`)

After login the default route is `/` (`HomePage.tsx`). This **dashboard**
(*pulpit makiety*, see §1) is the operational home screen for the
layout the user picked on the login form. It renders **three MUI
`DataGrid` / `Table` panels** stacked vertically (or tabbed on very
small screens), each fed by REST on mount and kept fresh by WebSocket
fan-out (§4.2).

#### 1. Layout vehicle roster

Default view: vehicles **added to this layout** (`GET
/api/v1/layouts/{layoutId}/vehicles`). Columns include at minimum DCC
address, name, owner login.

Toolbar actions (i18n keys in `home.json` / `vehicle.json`):

- **Pokaż moje pojazdy** (*Show my vehicles*) – toggles the table
  between the shared roster and the caller's own catalogue (`GET
  …/vehicles/mine`), marking which rows are already on the layout
  (`onLayout: true`). Lets a driver review their fleet without losing
  layout context.
- **Dodaj mój pojazd do makiety** (*Add my vehicle to layout*) –
  opens a picker dialog listing owned vehicles not yet on the roster;
  confirming fires `POST …/vehicles { vehicleAddr }`. Only vehicles
  the user **owns** may be added; leased vehicles are excluded.

Row actions (owner only): remove from layout (`DELETE …/vehicles/{addr}`).

#### 2. Online users

Live table of everyone currently connected to the layout (`GET
/api/v1/layouts/{layoutId}/presence`, updated on
`layout.presenceChanged`). Columns:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| Login | `login` |
| Role | effective role in this layout (`driver` / `signalman` / `admin`, via `role` namespace) |
| Interlocking | if the user occupies a signal box: interlocking name; otherwise em dash |

One row per **user**, not per tab – multiple WS sessions from the same
login collapse into a single row.

#### 3. Interlockings

Table of interlockings whitelisted in this layout (`GET
/api/v1/interlockings`, enriched with `occupant`). Columns: name,
location, **Obstawia** (*staffed by* – occupant login or "wolna" /
vacant). Rows are **clickable**: navigation to `/interlockings/:id`
(`InterlockingPage`).

All three panels share the active `layoutId` from `useMe()`; there is
no layout switcher on this page (layout is immutable for the session).

```tsx
// HomePage.tsx (structure sketch)
function HomePage() {
  const me = useMe().data!;
  const layoutId = me.layoutId;
  const [showMine, setShowMine] = useState(false);

  const vehicles = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["layout-vehicles", layoutId, showMine],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch(
        showMine
          ? `/api/v1/layouts/${layoutId}/vehicles/mine`
          : `/api/v1/layouts/${layoutId}/vehicles`,
      ).then((r) => r.json()),
  });
  // presence + interlockings analogous; useSocket merges WS events

  return (
    <Container maxWidth="lg">
      <LayoutVehiclesTable data={vehicles.data} showMine={showMine}
        onToggleMine={() => setShowMine((v) => !v)} layoutId={layoutId} />
      <OnlineUsersTable layoutId={layoutId} />
      <InterlockingsTable layoutId={layoutId} onRowClick={(id) => navigate(`/interlockings/${id}`)} />
    </Container>
  );
}
```

### 6.3d Interlocking view and occupation

Route: `/interlockings/:id` (`InterlockingPage.tsx`). Opened from the
dashboard interlockings table (§6.3c) or via direct link. Visible to
every authenticated user in the layout; **occupation controls** are
enabled only for users with the layout-scoped **signalman** role.

#### Layout of the page

1. **Header** – interlocking name, location, current occupant (live via
   `interlocking.occupantChanged`).
2. **Action bar** (signalmen only):
   - **Obsadź nastawnię** (*Occupy interlocking*) – visible when the
     caller is **not** the active occupant. Calls
     `POST /api/v1/interlockings/{id}/join`. If the box is vacant the
     join succeeds immediately. If another signalman is already
     staffing it, the UI shows a **confirmation dialog** naming the
     incumbent and explaining that they will be displaced; on confirm
     the client retries with `{ force: true }`. This prevents a
     forgotten session from blocking the interlocking indefinitely
     while still requiring an explicit human decision.
   - **Opuść nastawnię** (*Leave interlocking*) – visible when the
     caller **is** the active occupant. Calls
     `POST /api/v1/interlockings/{id}/leave`.
   - **Command-station picker (cog button)** – a **settings / cog icon**
     (`Settings`, identical to the throttle, §6.3b) that opens a setup
     dialog (`<ThrottleSetupDialog>` reused) hosting the
     **command-station dropdown** + connection status. The signalman
     needs a picked command station to **drive a taken-over target** in
     the throttle overlay (the throttle dispatch invariant requires
     `session.CommandStationID != nil`, §4.5.1) and to scope a per-target
     **„Zatrzymaj skład"** estop. It is populated from
     `session.opened.availableCommandStations`, fires
     `session.setCommandStation` on change, and re-renders on
     `session.commandStationChanged` / `layout.commandStationsChanged` —
     exactly like the throttle picker. When the list has a single entry
     the UI MAY auto-pick it.
3. **Radio Stop bar** – directly **above the panels** the staffed box
   renders a **Radio Stop** button (`<RadioStopButton variant="bar">`).
   It uses the **same red radio-handset icon** as the throttle button
   (§6.3b) but, unlike the icon-only throttle control, it shows the
   **text label „Radio stop"** next to the icon. Pressing it opens the
   same `<RadioStopConfirmOverlay>` and, on confirm, dispatches
   `system.radioStop {}` on the control plane (layout-wide halt, §4.6).
   It is shown to any **signalman** staffing the box (see the extended
   authorization in §4.6.2), independent of whether they currently hold a
   takeover.
4. **Three-panel work area** – below the Radio Stop bar the staffed box
   renders a **three-column layout**: a **radio chat** panel on the left,
   a **vehicle/train roster** panel in the centre, and a **train
   announcements** panel on the right (details below). On narrow screens
   the three collapse into tabs (Radio | Składy | Zapowiedzi).

##### Left panel – radio chat (`<InterlockingChatPanel>`)

The signalman's **group chat** with every driver in the layout. It is a
**fixed-width, vertically scrollable** column (`overflow-y: auto`)
showing all traffic exchanged with all drivers (§4.4.3) ordered by time.

- **Data:** seeded on mount via `radio.replay { scope:"interlocking", interlockingId }`
  (Redis-backed, §4.4.4) or the REST replay endpoint (§4.1), then kept
  live by `radio.message` events.
- **Line format:** `({driverLogin}) {vehicle or train name}: {radio
  phrase translated into the signalman's language}`. The login + context
  name come from the message's denormalized `from.login` /
  `context.*.name`; the phrase is rendered through the `radio.json` i18n
  catalogue (the closed `RadioPhrase` vocabulary maps 1:1 to keys, §7c).
- **Reply affordance:** each line carries a **„Odpowiedz"** icon button
  pinned to a **fixed position on the right** of the row. The chat text
  wraps (`white-space: normal`, the icon column has a fixed width) so the
  icon never shifts as the message grows. Pressing it opens the **phrase
  picker popup** (below) pre-addressed to that driver and pre-filled with
  the same vehicle/train context, so a reply stays in the same
  conversation thread.
- **Phrase picker popup (`<RadioPhrasePickerDialog>`):** instead of a
  free-text field this is a **searchable table** of the closed
  `RadioPhrase` vocabulary — one row per phrase showing its translated
  label (and optionally a short description), with a text **search box**
  in the header that filters rows client-side so the operator can *find
  a message visually* quickly. Selecting a row emits
  `radio.send { to:{ userId }, context:{ vehicleId | trainId }, phrase }`
  and plays `/sounds/interlockings/radio-sent.ogg` on ack. An optional
  capped `note` field may accompany the phrase.

##### Centre panel – vehicle/train roster (`<InterlockingRosterPanel>`)

A **fixed-width, scrollable** table of the vehicles and trains on the
current layout, with a **live "in motion" indicator** (derived from each
target's `loco.state.speed != 0`). The table header carries a **search
box** that filters rows **client-side**.

Columns:

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Skład** | `({driverLogin}) {vehicle or train name}` — the owner/driver login plus the train (skład) or single vehicle (lokomotywa) name. A small chip shows **„w ruchu"** when the target is moving. |
| **Akcje** | three icon buttons (left→right): **Radio**, **Stop**, **Przejęcie kontroli**. |

Action icons:

- **Radio** (`SettingsInputAntenna`) – opens the same
  `<RadioPhrasePickerDialog>` (searchable phrase table) pre-addressed to
  that driver, with the row's vehicle/train as the message context. Sends
  `radio.send`.
- **Stop** (`Stop`, red) – **„Zatrzymaj skład"**: emits
  `system.estopTarget { target, targetId }` (§4.2) to brake **only that
  one** vehicle/train. Distinct from the layout-wide Radio Stop (§4.6);
  the tooltip makes the single-target scope explicit.
- **Przejęcie kontroli** (`Engineering`) – opens the **takeover** flow
  (`takeover.request { target, targetId }`, §4.3). After the 15 s window
  grants the takeover, the signalman gets a closable throttle overlay
  (below) and the driver is evicted from their throttle.

##### Right panel – train announcements (`<InterlockingTrainAnnouncementsPanel>`)

A **fixed-width, scrollable** list of pre-configured station PA messages
for the **current interlocking**. Each row shows a human-readable label
(translated via i18n) and acts as a **play button** — there is no
confirmation step.

- **Data:** read from a **static TypeScript manifest**
  (`web/src/config/trainAnnouncements.ts`). The manifest maps interlocking
  **name** → ordered list of `{ soundKey, labelKey }` entries; a
  `"default"` key supplies the fallback list when a box has no dedicated
  catalogue. Labels resolve through the `trainAnnouncements` i18n
  namespace (`labelKey` → `trainAnnouncements.{labelKey}`). **No backend
  table, REST endpoint or WebSocket action** — editing the list is a
  frontend code change (manifest + i18n + Ogg asset).
- **Playback:** clicking a row plays
  `/sounds/train-announcements/{soundKey}.ogg` **locally on the clicking
  browser tab only** via `HTMLAudioElement` (same caching pattern as
  `useRadioSounds`). No WebSocket frame is sent; other users (including
  other signalmen staffing the same box from another device) do **not**
  hear the announcement.
- **Re-click:** starting a new announcement stops any in-flight
  announcement on that tab (`audio.pause(); audio.currentTime = 0`) before
  playing the newly selected file.
- **Empty state:** when the interlocking has no configured announcements
  the panel shows a short hint instead of an empty list.
- **Visibility:** shown only in the staffed work area (same gate as the
  chat and roster panels). Observers who have not occupied the box see the
  header and occupation controls but not the three-panel work area.

Example entries (labels in Polish; sound keys are kebab-case filenames
without the `.ogg` extension):

| Label (PL) | `soundKey` |
|------------|------------|
| Po torze 1 przejedzie pociąg towarowy | `track-1-freight` |
| Odjazd pociągu do st. Głuszyca | `departure-gluszyca` |
| Odjazd pociągu do st. Wrocław | `departure-wroclaw` |
| Odjazd pociągu do st. Warszawa Centralna | `departure-warszawa-centralna` |

Assets live under `web/public/sounds/train-announcements/`. To add or
change announcements, edit the manifest, the matching i18n keys and drop
the Ogg file — no migration or admin UI required.

##### Takeover throttle overlay (signalman drives without leaving the box)

When a takeover is **granted** (§4.3), the signalman does **not** leave
the interlocking view. Instead a **closable throttle overlay**
(`<TakeoverThrottleOverlay>`) opens **on top of** the interlocking view,
hosting the same `ThrottleCockpit` driving surface (§6.3a, §6.3b) for
the taken-over vehicle. The interlocking chat + roster stay mounted
underneath.

- The overlay is driven by the **5-minute self-lease** created on grant;
  a small countdown badge shows the remaining lease time
  (`takeover.granted.leaseExpiresAt`).
- **Close gate:** the overlay's close control is **disabled while the
  target's speed is not 0** (read from `loco.state`). The operator must
  bring the target to a standstill before closing. Closing the overlay
  (at speed 0) **releases the takeover** (revokes the lease, emits
  `takeover.released { reason:"signalman_released" }`).
- Leaving the interlocking, displacement, or the 5-minute lease expiry
  also release the takeover and tear the overlay down.

#### Leaving the view while still occupying

If the active occupant navigates away from `/interlockings/:id` (back
to the dashboard, admin page, browser back, …) while still holding an
`InterlockingSession`, the router **blocks** the transition and shows a
dialog:

> You are staffing this interlocking. Leave the interlocking?

- **Confirm** – `POST …/leave`, then proceed with navigation.
- **Cancel** – stay on the interlocking view.

Implementation: React Router `useBlocker` (or equivalent) keyed off
"am I the occupant?" local state synced from REST + WS. Closing the
browser tab does **not** auto-leave (the session stays until explicit
leave, displacement, or logout) – only in-app navigation triggers the
prompt.

#### Displaced occupant UX

When `interlocking.occupantChanged { reason:"displaced" }` targets the
current user, show a non-blocking toast, clear occupation state, and
disable takeover/radio actions that require active occupation until
they re-join or navigate away.

```tsx
// InterlockingPage.tsx (occupation hook sketch)
function useInterlockingOccupation(interlockingId: number) {
  const me = useMe().data!;
  const isSignalman = /* effective role in layout includes signalman */;

  const join = async (force = false) => {
    const res = await fetch(`/api/v1/interlockings/${interlockingId}/join`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ force }),
    });
    if (res.status === 409 && !force) {
      const incumbent = await res.json(); // { occupant: { login } }
      const ok = await confirmDisplaceDialog(incumbent);
      if (ok) return join(true);
      return;
    }
    // refresh local occupant state …
  };

  // useBlocker: when isOccupying && navigating away → leave dialog
  return { isSignalman, join, leave, isOccupying, … };
}
```

### 6.4 MUI Setup – Theme, Roboto Font, App Shell

Following [MUI's installation guide](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/),
install the core package, the styled-engine, the icons package, and the
Roboto font:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install @fontsource/roboto
```

`src/theme.ts` – central theme configuration. Material UI ships with
sensible defaults and a responsive 12-column grid; here we just tweak
palette and breakpoints to suit a throttle-style UI that must work on
small touchscreens:

```ts
import { createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";

export const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "dark", // a command station console is easier to read in dark mode
    primary: { main: "#90caf9" },
    error: { main: "#ef5350" },
  },
  shape: { borderRadius: 12 },
  components: {
    MuiSlider: {
      styleOverrides: {
        thumb: { width: 28, height: 28 }, // larger touch targets on phones
      },
    },
  },
});
```

`src/main.tsx` – wire up `ThemeProvider` + `CssBaseline` (CSS reset) and
the Roboto font once at the root:

```tsx
import "@fontsource/roboto/300.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/400.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/500.css";
import "@fontsource/roboto/700.css";

import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { ThemeProvider, CssBaseline } from "@mui/material";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { theme } from "./theme";
import { App } from "./App";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <CssBaseline />
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>,
);
```

`src/components/AppShell.tsx` – top-level navigation that adapts to
phone vs. desktop via MUI's `useMediaQuery` and breakpoint system:

```tsx
import { AppBar, Toolbar, Typography, IconButton, Drawer, useMediaQuery, useTheme } from "@mui/material";
import MenuIcon from "@mui/icons-material/Menu";
import { useState } from "react";

export function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const theme = useTheme();
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery(theme.breakpoints.down("md"));
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(!isMobile);

  return (
    <>
      <AppBar position="sticky">
        <Toolbar>
          {isMobile && (
            <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={() => setOpen((v) => !v)} edge="start">
              <MenuIcon />
            </IconButton>
          )}
          <Typography variant="h6">BigFred Control</Typography>
        </Toolbar>
      </AppBar>
      <Drawer
        variant={isMobile ? "temporary" : "permanent"}
        open={open}
        onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
      >
        {/* loco list / nav */}
      </Drawer>
      <main>{children}</main>
    </>
  );
}
```

### 6.5 Why Material UI Fits This Project

- **Accessibility out of the box.** `Slider`, `ToggleButton`, `IconButton`
  and friends ship with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard handling and
  focus management. This matters when the app is used on a phone with
  voice-over enabled or with a hardware keyboard.
- **Responsive primitives.** `Grid`, `Stack`, `useMediaQuery` and the
  `sx` prop make it trivial to render the same `LocoCard` as a wide row
  on desktop and as a single-column stack on a phone, without writing
  custom CSS.
- **Theming.** A single `createTheme` call defines colors, spacing,
  typography and touch-target sizes globally. Dark mode for a control
  room is a one-line switch.
- **Icon coverage.** `@mui/icons-material` exposes the full Material
  Symbols catalogue, which already contains everything a model railway
  UI needs (`PlayArrow`, `Stop`, `Lightbulb`, `VolumeUp`, `Settings`,
  `Power`, etc.) – no separate icon library required.
- **Maturity.** MUI is the largest React UI library; long-term support
  and community size reduce the risk of an unmaintained dependency in a
  hobby-but-long-lived project. See [MUI Overview](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).

### 6.6 REST via TanStack Query (List / Edit)

```ts
export const useLocos = () =>
  useQuery({
    queryKey: ["locos"],
    queryFn: () => fetch("/api/v1/locos").then((r) => r.json()),
  });
```

### 6.7 Script Buttons and Console (browser side)

With execution moved to the server (§3a.7), the **frontend's job is
trivial**: render a button per attached script that emits
`script.run` / `script.stop`, and a console pane that subscribes to
`script.log` events for the currently-displayed throttle. No
PyScript, no Web Worker, no Python source files. Goja runs on the
server; the browser just operates the play/stop button.

```tsx
// ScriptButtons.tsx
function ScriptButtons({ vehicle }: { vehicle: Vehicle }) {
  const { data: scripts = [] } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["vehicle-scripts", vehicle.addr],
    queryFn: () => fetch(`/api/v1/vehicles/${vehicle.addr}/scripts`).then(r => r.json()),
  });
  const { send } = useSocket();
  const activeRuns = useScriptStore((s) => s.activeRuns); // map<attachmentId, runId>

  return (
    <Stack direction="row" spacing={1}>
      {scripts.map((s) => {
        const runId = activeRuns[s.attachmentId];
        const running = !!runId;
        return (
          <IconButton
            key={s.attachmentId}
            color={running ? "secondary" : "primary"}
            onClick={() => {
              if (running) send({ type: "script.stop", payload: { runId } });
              else send({ type: "script.run",  payload: { scriptId: s.id, attachmentId: s.attachmentId } });
            }}
          >
            <FunctionIcon name={s.icon} />
          </IconButton>
        );
      })}
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

`useScriptStore` is a tiny Zustand slice that listens for
`script.runStarted` / `script.runStopped` events on the existing WS
and keeps `activeRuns[attachmentId] = runId`. That's the entire
client-side state. **Stop** on the phone is just
`send({ type:"script.stop", payload:{ runId } })` – the server
forwards it to the executor, which interrupts the VM.

`ScriptConsole.tsx` is a `<List>` that subscribes to `script.log`
events for the active throttle's `runId` and `script.runStopped`
events to flush the buffer with the final `{ reason, durationMs }`
line. The editor (`ScriptEditor.tsx`) on the Scripts page uses
`@monaco-editor/react` with `language="javascript"`, posts the
edited source via `PUT /api/v1/scripts/{id}`, and otherwise does
nothing executable.

### 6.8 Internationalization (pointer)

Every user-visible string in the components above (button labels,
error toasts, table headers, plural counters) is rendered through
`react-i18next` with namespace catalogues bundled into `web/dist`.
Backend codes (`ApiError.code`, `RadioPhrase`, `FunctionIcon`,
`AuditAction`, …) map 1:1 to translation keys; user-entered names
and audit-log denormalized snapshots are rendered verbatim. The
`I18nextProvider` wraps the app **above** `ThemeProvider` and
`QueryClientProvider` in `main.tsx`. The full specification —
namespace layout, key naming, plural rules, locale persistence,
type-safe key generation — lives in [§7c i18n](./09a-i18n.md).
Components in this section omit the boilerplate `t("…")` calls in
their snippets for brevity; in real code, no string literal that
reaches the DOM is hard-coded.
