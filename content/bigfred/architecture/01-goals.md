## Goals

### Platform goals

1. Be reachable from any modern browser on mobile and desktop.
2. Provide a real-time control surface for locomotives: speed, direction,
   functions, CV read/write and live status feedback from the command
   station.

### Functional goals (multi-user operations)

The application is a multi-user "operating session" tool, not just a
throttle. The following requirements are first-class concerns of the
domain model and the API:

1. **Authentication** – every user has a `login` and a numeric `PIN`
   (short PIN is chosen on purpose: easy to type on a phone in a club
   room; protected by hashing + rate-limiting, see §11).
2. **Roles** – three roles exist in the system:
   - `driver` – operates vehicles and trains,
   - `signalman` – occupies a signal box (interlocking) and directs
     traffic,
   - `admin` – manages users, roles and DCC address allocations.
3. **Role management** – `admin` can:
   - assign or revoke permanent roles,
   - grant **temporary roles** with an explicit expiry timestamp; the
     grant is automatically removed when it expires (no manual cleanup),
   - assign each user a **pool of DCC addresses** they are allowed to
     register vehicles under.
4. **Vehicle registration** – any user can register their own vehicles
   in the application **only within their assigned DCC pool**.
5. **Vehicle control** – a user can drive:
   - vehicles they own,
   - vehicles currently leased to them by another user (see below).
   Driving happens in **throttle mode** (§1, §6.3b): a full-screen overlay
   opened from the top AppBar, with real-time WebSocket control and
   server-authoritative state sync (including changes made by external
   throttles on the same command station).
6. **Layout dashboard** – after login the user lands on the **dashboard**
   (`/`) for their pinned layout. It shows three live tables (§6.3c):
   vehicles on the layout roster, online users (role + occupied
   interlocking, if any), and whitelisted interlockings with their
   current occupant. Drivers manage their vehicles on the roster; signalmen
   open interlocking views from the third table.
7. **Vehicle leasing** – a user can lend a vehicle to another user
   **for driving only** (no edit / no CV writes). Properties of a lease:
   - explicit `expires_at` timestamp; lease auto-expires after that
     moment with no manual action,
   - can be revoked early by the owner at any time,
   - lessee never inherits ownership or edit rights.
8. **Trains** – a user may create a **train** (`skład`) made up of at
   least one vehicle. The train is owned by the user that created it
   and can be leased exactly like a single vehicle (same `expires_at`
   / revoke semantics). The **train control view shows the same speed
   slider as the single-vehicle view**: moving the slider sets the
   speed of **every member vehicle in lock-step**, with members whose
   `Reversed` flag is `true` driven in the opposite direction so the
   whole consist moves as a rigid unit. Function buttons and scripts
   remain per-vehicle (each member keeps its own F0–F31 row); only
   the throttle is consolidated.
9. **Interlockings / Signal boxes** – the system models physical
   `interlockings` (`nastawnie`). At any moment **at most one signalman
   can occupy a given interlocking** in order to direct traffic from
   there. Occupation is managed from the **interlocking view** (§6.3d):
   signalmen click a row on the **dashboard**, then use **Obsadź
   nastawnię** / **Opuść nastawnię**. If the box is already staffed,
   another signalman may take over after confirming displacement so the
   interlocking cannot remain permanently blocked.
10. **Takeover by signalman** – an occupying signalman may request to
   take control of a driver's vehicle or train. The flow is:
   - signalman emits `takeover.request`,
   - driver receives `takeover.requested` and has **15 seconds** to
     reject it,
   - on `takeover.reject` from the driver, or if the driver leaves the
     session, the request is cancelled,
   - if the 15-second window elapses with no rejection, the signalman
     becomes the active controller; ownership is unchanged, but driving
     authority is moved.
11. **Radio ("walkie-talkie") between signalmen and drivers** – the app
    provides a built-in messaging channel between drivers and signalmen
    based on a closed set of **standard radio phrases** (for example
    `STOPPED_AT_SIGNAL_READY_TO_ENTER`, `ENTRY_PERMITTED`,
    `CANCEL_ROUTE`, `ACK`). Messages are short, structured, addressable
    and delivered over the same WebSocket connection.
12. **Programmable access (API keys + built-in MCP server)** – any user
    can mint **temporary API keys** scoped to their own permissions:
    - configurable lifetime up to a **hard maximum of 365 days**;
    - the plaintext key is shown to the user **exactly once** at
      creation time, only a hash is persisted;
    - keys can be revoked at any moment and auto-expire on
      `expires_at`;
    - keys are accepted by both the REST API (header
      `Authorization: Bearer rb_…`) and the **built-in MCP server**
      that the same Go binary exposes;
    - MCP exposes a curated tool surface (list locomotives, set speed,
      toggle function, send radio phrase, …) so AI assistants, IDE
      agents and automation scripts can drive the same domain via
      Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
13. **Layouts (modeling events) picked on the login form** – the
    application is multi-tenant in the soft sense that all users live
    in the same database, but every drive session happens inside a
    **layout** (`makieta`), and the choice is made **before the user
    is authenticated**:
    - the login screen carries three inputs: `login`, `PIN` and a
      **layout dropdown** (`makieta`). The dropdown is populated by
      the unauthenticated `GET /api/v1/layouts/login` endpoint,
      which returns every layout currently selectable (i.e. not
      locked). The system-provided **system layout** is always in
      that list and is the default pre-selection;
    - the system layout is seeded with `Name = "default"`,
      `IsSystem = true`, and is displayed in the UI as
      **"Domyślna (warsztat)"** (Polish) / **"Default (workshop)"**
      (English) via the `layout:system_default_label` i18n key. It is
      always available, cannot be locked, cannot be deleted, and its
      attached command stations are not editable – it always exposes
      the entire `command_stations` catalogue as a virtual set;
    - on a successful `POST /api/v1/auth/login { login, pin, layoutId }`
      the issued JWT carries `{ userId, layoutId }`; the WS upgrade
      reads `layoutId` from the token and pins the resulting drive
      session to that layout for its **entire lifetime**. **The user
      cannot change layout mid-session** – switching requires a full
      logout/login round trip. There is no post-login **layout picker**
      (the choice stays on the login form), but every user lands on
      the **dashboard** (`/`, §6.3c) for their pinned layout. There is
      no `setLayout` action;
    - **`admin` creates and deletes non-system layouts**; **any user
      may log into any non-locked layout**;
    - **a layout has no end date** – it stays in the catalogue until
      an admin deletes it;
    - **an admin may lock any non-system layout** via
      `POST /api/v1/layouts/{id}/lock`. A locked layout disappears
      from the login dropdown so no new drive sessions can be opened
      in it. Drive sessions already running in a layout that becomes
      locked are **NOT kicked** – they finish on their own. Unlocking
      via `DELETE /api/v1/layouts/{id}/lock` returns the row to the
      dropdown. The system layout cannot be locked;
    - each layout owns its own **layout-scoped signalmen list**: an
      admin may grant the `signalman` role to a user **only inside one
      specific layout**, and the user gains signalman powers
      exclusively while active in that layout (see §7a.2 for how this
      changes the effective-roles computation);
    - each layout owns a **vehicle roster** (`LayoutVehicle`): users
      add their own registered vehicles to the layout so they appear on
      the shared **dashboard** (§6.3c);
    - each layout owns its own **interlocking whitelist**: both
      `admin` and any signalman of the layout may add interlockings to
      it; **only the whitelisted interlockings are visible to drivers
      currently in that layout**;
    - admin-only management pages for layouts are reachable from
      `AppShell.tsx` (`/admin/layouts`), not from a post-login layout
      list. They expose name/lock toggle and the attached
      command-station set; the system layout's row is read-only in
      that page.
14. **Command stations catalogue (`centralki`)** – the physical DCC
    command station is a first-class entity, **independent of any
    specific layout**:
    - the system maintains a **catalogue of command stations**; each
      command station has a name and a **connection definition**
      describing how the backend reaches it:
      a) a **physical LocoNet socket** (serial / TTY device),
      b) **Z21 over network** (host + port),
      c) **LocoNet over Network** (host + port);
    - **only `admin` may create, edit or delete command stations**;
    - **a command station may be attached to any number of layouts**
      via a `LayoutCommandStation` join table managed by an admin
      (`POST/DELETE /api/v1/layouts/{id}/command-stations`). The
      system layout is the exception: every command station in the
      catalogue is **implicitly attached** to it – its set is virtual,
      always up to date, and **not editable** via any endpoint;
    - **every non-system layout must have at least one attached
      command station at all times** – creation requires a non-empty
      `commandStationIds` array, and detaching the last one is
      rejected with `layout_needs_at_least_one_command_station`;
    - inside the drive session the **driver picks one command station
      from the session layout's set** via a dropdown in the vehicle
      control view (`session.setCommandStation { commandStationId }`,
      §4.5). Until a pick is made, the throttle is gated and every
      command returns `command_station_not_selected`. Switching the
      pick later is allowed and is a controlled context switch: the
      emergency plan runs against the previous command station first,
      then the session re-points to the new one;
    - deleting a command station cascades cleanly: every layout that
      had it explicitly attached loses the row, every live drive
      session pinned to it is detached (CommandStationID → nil) and
      told to re-pick. The deletion itself is rejected with `409
      Conflict` if it would leave any non-system layout with zero
      attached stations.
15. **Audit log** – every significant state change is recorded in an
    **append-only audit log**. The scope is deliberately narrow and
    covers the operationally interesting events:
    - **vehicle leasing** – grant, revoke, auto-expire;
    - **train leasing** – grant, revoke, auto-expire;
    - **vehicle create / edit / delete**;
    - **train create / edit / delete**;
    - **"driver fell asleep"** (`maszynista zasnął`) – the
      dead-man's switch firing (§4.5), with the list of affected
      vehicles attached;
    - **command station create / edit / delete** (`centralka`);
    - **layout create / edit / delete** (`makieta`), plus **lock /
      unlock** and **command-station attach / detach** on a layout.

    Every entry MUST carry the following fields:

    | Field          | Type         | Notes                                                            |
    |----------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | action type    | `string`     | e.g. `vehicle.leased`, `session.emergency_executed`              |
    | user name      | `string`     | `user.login` **at the moment of the event** (denormalized)        |
    | user ID        | `uint`       | `user.id`                                                         |
    | date           | `time.Time`  | UTC; persisted with millisecond precision                         |
    | object ID      | `uint`       | id of the affected vehicle/train/command station/layout/session             |
    | object name    | `string`     | e.g. vehicle name, train name, command station name (denormalized)         |

    Denormalization of `user name` and `object name` is intentional:
    deleting or renaming a user/vehicle later **must not rewrite
    history**. The audit log is read-only for everyone (no DELETE/UPDATE
    endpoints) and visible only to `admin`. See §3a.5 for the entity,
    §4.1 for the REST surface and §10.6 for the acceptance criteria.
16. **Vehicle functions (`F0`–`F31`)** – every vehicle exposes a
    user-curated list of DCC functions that drivers can toggle from
    the throttle UI:
    - the underlying DCC function range is **`F0`–`F31`** (32
      possible slots, aligned with Z21 FW ≥1.42); a given vehicle may
      register **any number** of slots from that range (zero, several,
      or all of them) – the owner registers only those that physically
      exist on the decoder;
    - each registered function carries: the function number, a
      user-given **title** (*tytuł*), an **icon** from the closed
      catalogue in §3a.8 (67 icons, Polish labels in the picker) and a
      **position** that defines button order on the throttle;
    - the owner edits the list on a dedicated page reached from the
      vehicle catalogue (**Edytuj funkcje**, §6.3e); reordering there
      changes the throttle button row immediately;
    - **only the vehicle's owner** may edit the function definitions;
      lessees and signalmen who took the vehicle over may **invoke**
      functions while they have driving authority, but never edit the
      list.
17. **Vehicle templates with copy-on-write inheritance** – the system
    has a catalogue of **vehicle templates** (`szablony pojazdów`)
    that pre-define a function list for a class of vehicles
    (e.g. "PKP ET22", "DB BR 218", "Bachmann 0-6-0 with sound"):
    - any user can create templates; the **owner** of a template (or
      admin) may edit it;
    - when registering a new vehicle, the user may optionally pick a
      template; the new vehicle is then **linked** to that template
      and its function list is **virtual** – served live from the
      template at read time;
    - **as long as the user does not edit a function on the
      vehicle**, the vehicle's function list **stays in sync** with
      the template: adding, renaming, removing or re-icon-ing
      functions in the template is immediately visible on every linked
      vehicle;
    - **the first edit the user makes to a function on their vehicle
      detaches the vehicle** from the template with **copy-on-write**:
      the entire template function list is snapshotted into the
      vehicle's own rows in a single transaction, and the requested
      edit is applied on the copy. Future template changes no longer
      affect this vehicle;
    - the user can also explicitly **detach** (manual copy) or
      **re-attach** (drop local edits, re-sync to template's current
      state) via dedicated endpoints.
18. **Persistent drive session with dead-man's switch** – the
    WebSocket connection is treated as a **drive session**, not just a
    transport:
    - the server tracks per-user sessions with a heartbeat
      (WS `ping`/`pong` every 10 s, plus an explicit application-level
      `ping` from the client every few seconds);
    - if the connection is closed (app shut down, tab closed, browser
      crash) or if heartbeats stop arriving for longer than a
      configurable **grace period** (default 5 s), the session is
      declared **lost**;
    - when the **last remaining session of a user** is lost, the server
      executes the user's configured **emergency action**, which by
      default is **stop all vehicles currently under that user's
      active control** (`SetSpeed(0)` on every owned + leased-in +
      taken-over vehicle being driven from any of their sessions);
    - other emergency actions are available per user/session preference
      (`release_my_leases`, `none` for testing, `estop_all` reserved
      for admins);
    - a successful reconnect within the grace window **cancels** the
      pending emergency.

19. **Scripts – server-side JavaScript automation attached to vehicles
    and trains** – the app exposes a **Scripts** tab where any user
    can author short **JavaScript (ECMAScript 5.1+)** programs that
    automate driving. Architecturally scripts live entirely on the
    backend:
    - scripts are stored as plain text and **executed server-side**
      in a sandboxed [Goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) VM
      (pure-Go ES5.1 engine, no cgo). Each running script gets its
      **own `*goja.Runtime` owned by exactly one goroutine** (Goja
      VMs are explicitly **not goroutine-safe**, see Goja's FAQ);
    - to protect the main server, the Goja VMs do **not** run inside
      the `server` process. They run inside a separate
      **`scripts-executor` process** spawned by the server. The
      executor reuses the **same Go codebase** (same `pkgs/bigfred/server`
      domain, services, security layer) – the only difference is the
      `main()` entry point: instead of opening REST/WS sockets it
      opens an internal RPC channel and waits for run requests. A
      runaway script (infinite loop, OOM, panic in a Go binding,
      Goja itself misbehaving) takes down the executor, **never the
      throttle server**;
    - the frontend never sees JavaScript. It hands the user's source
      to the server over REST and presses a play button over WS. The
      server forwards the run request to the executor over the
      internal RPC channel and proxies events (`log`, `runStarted`,
      `runStopped`) back to the frontend;
    - the script is **attached to a single vehicle or a single
      train**, the same way functions are attached to vehicles, and
      gets its own **icon picked from the function-icon catalogue**
      so it can be invoked from the throttle UI just like an `F0`–
      `F31` button;
    - the executor exposes a small, **deliberately limited DSL** that
      operates **only within the attached scope** – the canonical
      example:

        ```javascript
        const loco = findFirstLoco();   // first member with Kind=loco in the train,
                                        // or the attached vehicle iff it is a loco
        loco.setSpeed(10);              // 0..126, same semantics as loco.setSpeed WS

        const wagon = findByDCCAddr(815); // lookup is RESTRICTED to attachment scope
        wagon.funcOn(5);                  // F5 ON  (same as vehicle.setFunction)
        sleep(5);                         // blocks ONLY this script's goroutine
                                          // (not the server, not the executor's other VMs)
        wagon.funcOff(5);                 // F5 OFF
        ```

    - every DSL call is a Go binding that goes through the **same
      `LocoService` / `TrainService` and the same security policy
      layer (§7a.3) as a manual throttle press**, so authorization,
      lease checks, takeover handoff, audit and the dead-man's switch
      contract apply unchanged: a script can **never do anything its
      user could not do manually**;
    - scripts are **edited only by their owner**; a lessee of a
      vehicle/train sees the script icon on the throttle and can
      **run** the script (their driving authority is the limit), but
      cannot view or change its source;
    - **start, stop and progress** of a running script are mirrored
      across all of the owner's open sessions (phone + desktop), so
      tapping "stop" on the phone halts the script regardless of
      where it was started. **Stop** is implemented server-side via
      `vm.Interrupt(...)` from a sibling goroutine in the executor.

20. **Radio Stop – layout-wide emergency halt** – any user who may drive
    at least one vehicle or train in the active layout can trigger a
    **Radio Stop** from the throttle overlay. The signal:
    - issues a DCC emergency stop to **every vehicle on the layout
      roster**, across **all** attached command stations;
    - additionally **fires every connected driver's dead-man's-switch
      emergency plan** (clamped to the `stop_my_vehicles`…`release_my_leases`
      band, never escalating to the admin-only `estop_all`), so each
      operator's own fail-safe (scripts, leases) runs as if their last
      session had dropped (§4.6.1a);
    - plays a radiostop alarm sound (`/sounds/radiostop.ogg`) on
      **every open throttle session** in the layout;
    - interrupts running scripts with reason `"radio_stop"`;
    - is audited (`system.radio_stop`).
    It is triggered from a red button on the throttle overlay's left
    toolbar (next to the Fullscreen toggle) behind a confirmation
    overlay. Radio Stop is separate from the per-session emergency brake
    (`system.estop`), the **automatic** dead-man's switch, admin-only
    `estop_all`, and walkie-talkie phrases such as `STOP_IMMEDIATELY`
    (§4.6).
21. **Sudo elevation – temporary `admin`/`signalman` powers gated by a
    layout-scoped PIN.** Every **layout** owns an **admin PIN** that is
    independent of any user PIN. A user already authenticated into that
    layout can **self-elevate** their effective role for a short, fixed
    window by typing the layout's admin PIN, in the spirit of `sudo` on
    Linux. The mechanism is exposed through two icons on the top
    `AppBar`:
    - a **closed-padlock icon** – clicking it opens a dialog asking for
      the layout admin PIN; on success the caller's effective roles
      gain `admin` for **2 minutes** (configurable, hard cap 10 min);
      the icon flips to an **open padlock with a live countdown** for
      the duration of the grant, and reverts when the grant expires;
    - a **signalman icon** (engineer's cap) – same dialog, same PIN; on
      success the caller is granted the **layout-scoped `signalman`**
      role for the same 2-minute window, exclusively inside the active
      layout.

    Properties:
    - the same PIN gates both icons – a layout has one admin PIN, not
      two; and that single PIN never grants the user any access outside
      the layout it belongs to;
    - **the admin PIN can be reset by an admin** in the layout settings
      page by typing a new PIN and clicking *Save*; **leaving the field
      blank does NOT reset the PIN** – the page only changes the PIN
      when the field carries a value. The PIN is stored as
      `Layout.AdminPINHash` (argon2id) and the plaintext never leaves
      the dialog;
    - **sudo-elevated `admin` powers do NOT grant the right to edit
      layout settings** (rename, lock/unlock, attach/detach command
      stations, manage signalmen list, manage interlocking whitelist,
      delete the layout, **and crucially – reset the admin PIN
      itself**). This single exception prevents a sudo-elevated user
      from rotating the PIN to lock the real admin out, and matches
      the goal that sudo is for *operational* admin work (DCC pool
      tweaks, registering a vehicle outside the user's pool while
      troubleshooting, …), not *organisational* admin work;
    - the same exception does **not** apply to users who hold the
      permanent `admin` role: they can rotate the PIN exactly like any
      other layout setting;
    - sudo elevation is mirrored across every WebSocket session the
      user has open: starting it from the desktop instantly enables
      the lock indicator on the phone, and the auto-expiry fans out
      to every session simultaneously;
    - failed PIN attempts are rate-limited per `(userId, layoutId)`
      and per IP analogously to login (§7a.1) so the PIN cannot be
      brute-forced in a club room;
    - every `sudo` grant, expiry and PIN reset is **audited**
      (§3a.5: `auth.sudo_granted`, `auth.sudo_expired`,
      `layout.admin_pin_changed`).

These functional goals drive the domain model (§3a), the REST surface
(§4.1), the WebSocket protocol (§4.2), the **drive-session contract
and dead-man's switch (§4.5)**, the **Radio Stop contract (§4.6)**,
the **layout / command station addressing rules (§3a.4)**, the
**audit log (§3a.5)**, the **vehicle functions and template
inheritance (§3a.6)**, the **server-side scripting model in the
sibling `scripts-executor` (§3a.7)**, the authorization rules
(§7a) **including the sudo elevation flow (§7a.7)** and the MCP
integration (§7b).
