### §7e.2 Process model, CLI & supervisord wiring

#### Cobra subcommand

`dcc-bus` is a new top-level cobra command on the existing
`loco-server` binary, registered alongside the implicit `serve`
command and the `scripts-executor` subcommand:

```
loco-server                 # default: HTTP + WS + supervisord (the existing entry point)
loco-server scripts-executor --executor-socket <path>   # §3a.7
loco-server dcc-bus --layout-id <L> --command-station-id <C> --port <P>   # NEW
```

The single-binary approach (§7d.4) is preserved: `os.Args[0]` is the
absolute path the process was exec'd with, and supervisord is told the
same path with different subcommand arguments. CI builds one binary,
deployment ships one binary.

#### CLI flags

| Flag | Type | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--layout-id` | uint | yes | – | `LayoutID` the daemon is bound to. Validated against the JWT on every WS upgrade. |
| `--command-station-id` | uint | yes | – | `CommandStationID` the daemon owns (identity + Redis key suffix). |
| `--port` | uint16 | yes | – | TCP port the WebSocket listener binds to. **Allocated by `loco-server`**, never hard-coded. |
| `--bind` | string | no | `127.0.0.1` | Interface to bind on. **Loopback by default** because the frontend reaches the daemon through `loco-server`'s reverse proxy (§7e.6). |
| `--station-name` | string | yes | – | Display name of the command station (for logs). Set by `loco-server` from the `command_stations` row when the program is registered. |
| `--station-kind` | string | yes | – | Driver kind: `z21` \| `loconet_serial` \| `loconet_tcp`. |
| `--station-uri` | string | yes | – | Connection URI passed to `pkgs/loco/commandstation` (e.g. `udp://192.168.0.111:21105`, `serial:///dev/ttyUSB0:57600`). |
| `--speed-steps` | uint | no | `128` | DCC speed steps (14, 28, or 128). |
| `--jwt-secret` | string | no | `$BIGFRED_JWT_SECRET` | HMAC secret shared with `loco-server`. Missing secret → fatal startup error. |
| `--redis-addr` | string | no | `127.0.0.1:6379` | Redis for state cache, roster snapshots, and pub/sub. Boot fails if `PING` does not succeed. |
| `--heartbeat-secs` | float | no | `5` | WS keepalive interval advertised to clients. |
| `--deadman-secs` | float | no | `6` | Idle window after which the daemon applies emergency stop to the client's subscribed addresses. |
| `--poll-interval-ms` | uint | no | `0` (→ `750`) | State-feed polling cadence for drivers without push. Ignored when the driver implements `StateObserver` (LocoNet and Z21). See §7e.9. |
| `--allowed-origin` | string[] | no | – | Optional WS `Origin` allow-list (repeatable). Empty → permissive; production usually proxies through `loco-server`. |

Flag names are defined once in `pkgs/bigfred/dcc-bus/cli` (`station.go`,
`AppendStationFlags`) so `loco-server` and the daemon stay in sync.

Validation rules applied at boot (before accepting WS clients):

1. `--layout-id` and `--command-station-id` are non-zero; `--command-station-id` matches the station config baked into the CLI flags.
2. `--station-kind` is a known `CommandStationKind`; `--station-uri` is non-empty.
3. `--jwt-secret` (or `BIGFRED_JWT_SECRET`) is non-empty.
4. `--port` is non-zero.
5. Redis `PING` succeeds.
6. Optional `GET` of `bigfred:layout:<L>:allowed_vehicles` and `defined_trains` seeds the in-memory roster (empty until the server publishes).
7. `commandstation` driver opens successfully against `--station-uri`. Failure → exit non-zero; supervisord `autorestart` retries.

**Layout ↔ command-station attachment** is enforced by `loco-server` before it registers the supervisord program; the daemon does not re-check SQLite.

#### Program registration

`loco-server` registers `dcc-bus` programs through
`SupervisordService.UpsertProgram` (§7d.2). The group name is
`dcc-bus`; the program name is
`dcc-bus-<layoutId>-<commandStationId>` (e.g.
`dcc-bus-1-2`). The shell command rendered into supervisord's INI is:

```
/usr/local/bin/loco-server dcc-bus \
  --layout-id 1 \
  --command-station-id 2 \
  --port 9201 \
  --bind 127.0.0.1 \
  --station-name "Main Z21" \
  --station-kind z21 \
  --station-uri "udp://192.168.0.111:21105" \
  --speed-steps 128 \
  --jwt-secret "$BIGFRED_JWT_SECRET" \
  --redis-addr 127.0.0.1:6379
```

The `--jwt-secret` value is rendered inline by `loco-server` from
the same `BIGFRED_JWT_SECRET` env var that `loco-server` itself reads
(§cli/root.go `resolveJWTSecret`). It is shell-quoted by the
`shellQuote` template helper (§7d.2) so a secret with special
characters is safe.

```go
spec := supervisord.ProgramSpec{
    Name:        fmt.Sprintf("dcc-bus-%d-%d", layoutID, csID),
    Command:     dccBusCommandLine(layoutID, csID, port, …),
    Autostart:   true,
    Autorestart: true,
    StopWaitSecs: 5,
    StartSecs:    1,
}
supSvc.UpsertProgram(ctx, "dcc-bus", spec)
```

A removed daemon is similarly cleaned up by
`SupervisordService.RemoveProgram(ctx, "dcc-bus", name)`. Adding /
removing a program is a hot reload (`reread` + `update`, §7d.3) and
does **not** disturb other `dcc-bus-*` programs.

#### Port allocation

`loco-server` owns the port pool. There is no system call that picks
a "free" port and hands it to a child cleanly across processes, so
the chosen scheme is:

1. A configurable range, **default `[9200, 9209]`** (10 ports — in
   practice an installation has at most a handful of command stations,
   typically one "main track" + one "programming track"), is reserved
   at server boot via `--dcc-bus-port-min` / `--dcc-bus-port-max`
   flags on `loco-server`.
2. `LocoService` (renamed to `DccBusOrchestrator`, §7e.6) keeps a
   `map[(layoutID, csID)] → port` allocation table in memory and
   mirrored to Redis (`HSET dcc-bus:ports <layoutId>:<csID> <port>`)
   so a `loco-server` restart re-uses the previous mapping while
   `dcc-bus` programs continue to run.
3. A new `(layout, cs)` pair gets the lowest unused port in the
   range. If the range is exhausted, `LayoutService` /
   `SessionService` returns `422 no_dcc_bus_ports_available` and
   logs a warning; the operator is expected to widen the range.
4. The chosen port is **rendered into the supervisord config** as a
   plain CLI flag; the `dcc-bus` process listens on whatever its
   `--port` says. There is **no port-discovery handshake** between
   the two processes — supervisord-managed args are the source of
   truth.

#### Lazy lifecycle

A `dcc-bus` program exists in supervisord's desired state iff at
least one of the following is true:

- a live `DriveSession` has `(LayoutID == L, CommandStationID == C)`, or
- the operator pinned the daemon manually via an admin endpoint
  (future, not M3).

State machine:

```
   (none)
     │  first session.setCommandStation { commandStationId = C }
     │  on a session pinned to layout L succeeds
     ▼
   (starting)
     │  supervisord reports RUNNING + WS dial probe succeeds
     ▼
   (running)
     │  last session pinned to (L,C) detaches (closed connection,
     │  setCommandStation to a different id, layout deletion)
     │  AND idle-timeout elapses (default: never; configurable)
     ▼
   (stopping) — supervisorctl stop + RemoveProgram (UpsertProgram with
                desired-state minus this entry)
     │
     ▼
   (none)
```

For the first cut **idle-timeout defaults to `never`**: once started,
a daemon stays running until `loco-server` shutdown or until the
underlying `LayoutCommandStation` row goes away. This keeps the WS
endpoint stable for the frontend; the slight cost is one extra
process per `(L, C)` pair, which we already pay for via supervisord
isolation.

A `--dcc-bus-idle-timeout` flag on `loco-server` may be used to
shorten this (e.g. tests). When non-zero, the orchestrator waits for
"no sessions pinned to (L, C) for `timeout`" before issuing
`RemoveProgram`.

#### Graceful shutdown of a single daemon

When `loco-server` shuts down or the operator stops a daemon
(`supervisorctl stop dcc-bus-1-2`):

1. The daemon receives `SIGTERM` (the default supervisord stop
   signal) and enters drain mode.
2. It publishes `dcc-bus:<layoutId>:<csId>:status = "draining"` on
   Redis so the WS hub on `loco-server` may surface a banner.
3. It rejects any new WS frames with `ack { ok:false, error:"draining" }`.
4. For each connected client, it runs the **per-session emergency
   plan** against that client's `DriveTargets` (§7e.5) using the
   normal `SetSpeed(0)` path. This must finish within
   `--shutdown-timeout` (default 5 s).
5. It writes a final `loco:state` snapshot to Redis for every
   subscribed vehicle.
6. It closes the DCC bus (`Station.CleanUp()` from
   `pkgs/loco/commandstation`).
7. It exits 0.

If `--shutdown-timeout` elapses, supervisord sends `SIGKILL`. The
state in Redis is preserved (the cache reflects the last successfully
written value); peer daemons / a future restart will reconcile against
the live command station within one poll cycle.

#### Boot ordering with respect to `loco-server`

`loco-server` is the **only writer** to the supervisord config
(§7d.3). Therefore:

- supervisord is started by `loco-server.Start` (already true today).
- The initial `DesiredState` rendered by `loco-server` may contain
  zero or more `dcc-bus-*` programs — initially zero on a brand-new
  install (no sessions yet). The very first
  `session.setCommandStation { commandStationId = C }` after login
  triggers `UpsertProgram("dcc-bus", spec)`; `loco-server` blocks
  the WS `ack` until the new daemon is RUNNING and dial-able (or
  returns `ack { ok:false, error:"dcc_bus_unavailable" }` after a 10 s
  timeout).
- On a clean restart of `loco-server`, `dcc-bus` programs that were
  in supervisord's desired state continue running uninterrupted —
  supervisord's hot-reload model (§7d.3) makes the new server's
  config a superset / equal of what is already running, and
  `reread + update` is a no-op when nothing changed.

#### Failure modes summary

| Failure | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `dcc-bus` panics in the DCC driver | supervisord respawns (`autorestart=true`); throttles see a brief `loco.error { code:"dcc_bus_restarting" }` followed by reconnect. `loco-server` keeps serving REST and non-throttle WS unchanged. |
| `dcc-bus` cannot dial the command station at boot | Exit non-zero; supervisord's BACKOFF state holds it (and surfaces in `system.status`); throttles see `loco.error { code:"command_station_unreachable" }`. |
| `--port` already in use on the host | Daemon exits with `port_in_use`; supervisord backoff; `loco-server` allocates the next port from the pool on the next restart. |
| `loco-server` SIGTERM | `SupervisordService.Stop` (§7d.3) sends `supervisorctl shutdown`, which drains every `dcc-bus-*` program with their own SIGTERM + drain logic. No orphaned daemons (`ps` assertion in §7e.8 #6). |
| `dcc-bus` cannot reach Redis | Boot fails (`PING` required). If Redis drops at runtime, roster updates and `loco:state` reads fail; the daemon keeps running but subscribe/drive gates may be stale until Redis returns. |
| Stale roster snapshot | Daemon serves the last `allowed_vehicles` / `defined_trains` payload received. `loco-server` republishes on every roster mutation and at bootstrap. |
| Command-station URI changed in admin | Supervisord program must be re-rendered (`DccBusService` sync) so the new `--station-uri` reaches the child; a running daemon is not hot-reloaded. |
