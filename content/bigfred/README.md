# BigFred – Web Application Architecture Plan

This document describes the proposed architecture for a web application that
controls model railroad locomotives. It builds on top of the existing
`pkgs/loco` and `pkgs/rb` packages (Go core), which already provide a clean
`LocoApp` controller layer, a `Station` interface (Z21, LocoNet) and SQLite
access via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, `CGO_ENABLED=0`).

The architecture is split across multiple files under
[`./architecture/`](./architecture/). For an orientation read start at
the [architecture index](./architecture/README.md); for a specific
topic, jump directly to one of the sections below.

Section numbering used in the prose (`§3a.4`, `§4.5`, `§7b.1`, …) is
preserved verbatim in the headings of the split files, so existing
cross-references inside the text still work via `Ctrl+F`.

On the Go server, responsibilities are split across three packages under
`pkgs/bigfred/server/`: **`http`** (and **`ws`**) terminate transport and
authentication; **`service`** owns validation, orchestration, and
permission checks via **`security`**; see
[§3.1 Backend layer responsibilities](./architecture/04-repository-layout.md#31-backend-layer-responsibilities).

## Implementation plans

Task-scoped implementation plans live under [`./plans/`](./plans/):

- [M5 – Interlocking view, radio & takeover](./plans/m5-interlocking-radio-takeover.md)
- [M5.1 – Train announcements panel](./plans/train-announcements-panel.md)
