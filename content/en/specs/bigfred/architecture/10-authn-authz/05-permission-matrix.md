¹ `admin` is a management role only; if an admin also needs to drive,
   they must additionally hold the `driver` role (permanent or
   temporary).
² Takeover is only available to the signalman currently occupying an
   interlocking; idle signalmen do not have this power.
³ A permanent `admin` (or a sudo-elevated one) may register a vehicle
   that falls **outside** any DCC-pool – this is a deliberate
   operational override for troubleshooting (e.g. registering a guest
   loco mid-session). `LocoSecurityContext.CanRegisterLoco` accepts
   `domain.EffectiveRoles` and short-circuits to `Allow` when the
   actor `Has(domain.RoleAdmin)`.
⁴ "Layout settings" covers the operations gated by
   `LayoutSecurityContext.CanEditLayout` and friends in §7a.3:
   rename, lock/unlock, command-station attach/detach, layout-scoped
   signalmen list, interlocking whitelist removal, layout deletion
   and admin-PIN rotation. A sudo admin grants the same authority as
   a permanent admin everywhere — the 2-minute window plus the
   rate-limiter on the PIN dialog are the only guard rails (§7a.7).
⁵ Radio Stop is authorized by **either** drive scope **or** the
   `signalman` role (§4.6.2). A signalman may halt the layout even when
   **idle** — without occupying an interlocking or holding a takeover —
   so the layout's traffic director always has the emergency halt at
   hand. (The earlier rule only allowed it mid-takeover.)

The signalman icon next to the padlock (§7a.7) is **not** a sudo
elevation: it writes a permanent `LayoutSignalman` row with
`expires_at = NULL`, so a user that promotes themselves keeps the
signalman role inside that layout until they (or an admin) revoke
it. The matrix row "signalman (idle)" / "signalman (active takeover)"
applies to such a user from the moment the row is persisted.
